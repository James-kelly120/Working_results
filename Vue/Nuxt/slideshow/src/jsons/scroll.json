If you٧ve never used a modern JavaScript framework, building your first app that just displays ٪Hello٫ can take a whole week!

If your app is simple, you can use Vue just like jQuery - by dropping in a <script>tag. But as your skills and needs grow more advanced, Vue grows with you to make you more powerful and productive."
